Authors: Terry Phung, David Yin, Cherry Lim Siang Sue

This project is of the third coursework of PPA

A predator-prey simulation involving Ocean animals.

How to start:
    Create a Simulator object.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
