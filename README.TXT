Project: Ocean World
Authors: Terry Phung, David Yin, Cherry Lim Siang Sue

This project is of the third coursework of PPA

A predator-prey simulation involving Ocean animals.

How to start:
    Create a Simulator object.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
        + runLongSlowestSimulation - for a slow motion of the simulation
	+ runSlowSimulation - for a slower simulation (testing purposes)

Tasks completed : 
 + Gender
 + Different Types of Animals
 + Plants
